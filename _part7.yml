## Session Provider Configuration
##
## The session cookies identify the user once logged in.
## The available providers are: `memory`, `redis`. Memory is the provider unless redis is defined.
session:
  ## The name of the session cookie.
  name: authelia_session

  ## The domain to protect.
  ## Note: the authenticator must also be in that domain.
  ## If empty, the cookie is restricted to the subdomain of the issuer.
  domain: example.com

  ## Sets the Cookie SameSite value. Possible options are none, lax, or strict.
  ## Please read https://www.authelia.com/c/session#same_site
  same_site: lax

  ## The secret to encrypt the session data. This is only used with Redis / Redis Sentinel.
  ## Secret can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
  secret: insecure_session_secret

  ## The value for expiration, inactivity, and remember_me_duration are in seconds or the duration notation format.
  ## See: https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  ## All three of these values affect the cookie/session validity period. Longer periods are considered less secure
  ## because a stolen cookie will last longer giving attackers more time to spy or attack.

  ## The time before the cookie expires and the session is destroyed if remember me IS NOT selected.
  expiration: 1h

  ## The inactivity time before the session is reset. If expiration is set to 1h, and this is set to 5m, if the user
  ## does not select the remember me option their session will get destroyed after 1h, or after 5m since the last time
  ## Authelia detected user activity.
  inactivity: 5m

  ## The time before the cookie expires and the session is destroyed if remember me IS selected.
  ## Value of -1 disables remember me.
  remember_me_duration: 1M
