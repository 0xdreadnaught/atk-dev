  ## Adjust the interaction timeout for Webauthn dialogues.
  timeout: 60s

  ## The display name the browser should show the user for when using Webauthn to login/register.
  display_name: Authelia

  ## Conveyance preference controls if we collect the attestation statement including the AAGUID from the device.
  ## Options are none, indirect, direct.
  attestation_conveyance_preference: indirect

  ## User verification controls if the user must make a gesture or action to confirm they are present.
  ## Options are required, preferred, discouraged.
  user_verification: preferred

##
## Duo Push API Configuration
##
## Parameters used to contact the Duo API. Those are generated when you protect an application of type
## "Partner Auth API" in the management panel.
# duo_api:
  # disable: false
  # hostname: api-123456789.example.com
  # integration_key: ABCDEF
  ## Secret can also be set using a secret: https://www.authelia.com/c/secrets
  # secret_key: 1234567890abcdefghifjkl
  # enable_self_enrollment: false

##
## NTP Configuration
##
## This is used to validate the servers time is accurate enough to validate TOTP.
ntp:
  ## NTP server address.
  address: "time.cloudflare.com:123"

  ## NTP version.
  version: 4

  ## Maximum allowed time offset between the host and the NTP server.
  max_desync: 3s

  ## Disables the NTP check on startup entirely. This means Authelia will not contact a remote service at all if you
  ## set this to true, and can operate in a truly offline mode.
  disable_startup_check: false

  ## The default of false will prevent startup only if we can contact the NTP server and the time is out of sync with
  ## the NTP server more than the configured max_desync. If you set this to true, an error will be logged but startup
  ## will continue regardless of results.
  disable_failure: false

##
## Authentication Backend Provider Configuration
##
## Used for verifying user passwords and retrieve information such as email address and groups users belong to.
##
## The available providers are: `file`, `ldap`. You must use only one of these providers.
authentication_backend:

  ## Password Reset Options.
  password_reset:
    ## Disable both the HTML element and the API for reset password functionality.
    disable: false

    ## External reset password url that redirects the user to an external reset portal. This disables the internal reset
    ## functionality.
    custom_url: ""

  ## The amount of time to wait before we refresh data from the authentication backend. Uses duration notation.
  ## To disable this feature set it to 'disable', this will slightly reduce security because for Authelia, users will
  ## always belong to groups they belonged to at the time of login even if they have been removed from them in LDAP.
  ## To force update on every request you can set this to '0' or 'always', this will increase processor demand.
  ## See the below documentation for more information.
  ## Duration Notation docs:  https://www.authelia.com/c/common#duration-notation-format
  ## Refresh Interval docs: https://www.authelia.com/c/1fa#refresh-interval
  refresh_interval: 5m

  ##
  ## LDAP (Authentication Provider)
  ##
  ## This is the recommended Authentication Provider in production
  ## because it allows Authelia to offload the stateful operations
  ## onto the LDAP service.
  # ldap:
    ## The LDAP implementation, this affects elements like the attribute utilised for resetting a password.
    ## Acceptable options are as follows:
    ## - 'activedirectory' - For Microsoft Active Directory.
    ## - 'custom' - For custom specifications of attributes and filters.
    ## This currently defaults to 'custom' to maintain existing behaviour.
    ##
    ## Depending on the option here certain other values in this section have a default value, notably all of the
    ## attribute mappings have a default value that this config overrides, you can read more about these default values
    ## at https://www.authelia.com/c/ldap#defaults
    # implementation: custom

    ## The url to the ldap server. Format: <scheme>://<address>[:<port>].
    ## Scheme can be ldap or ldaps in the format (port optional).
    # url: ldap://127.0.0.1

    ## The dial timeout for LDAP.
